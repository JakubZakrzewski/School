My first program. <br>
It was written as an individual, final task as a part of <i> Java basic </i> workshop
organised by <i> Computer Science Student association SKNI SGH </i> <br>
Despite many ideas for correcting the code, that came to my mind after a short time, I decided not to make any corrections.
I commited the code in the original version, as it was written at the very beginning, replacing only Polish-language elements with their English equivalents.
Thanks to this, in the future, I want to be able to see one of the first fragments of the code I wrote, without any later corrections.

The task was to write an electronic register in accordance with guidelines formulated by lecturers. 
Moreover, I added several functions exceeding required minimum as a part of additional learning and experiments. <br>
<i><b> Case </b><br>
Write an electronic register for students. Create enum Subject containing 4 subjects (Mathematics, Polish Language, Physics, Geography). 
Based on abstract class - Human, create subclasses: <br>
Teacher - has a students list and a list of their grades <br>
Student - has a list of grades from each subject (4 different lists) <br>
Students can be assigned to several teachers. Teachers are assigned to one subject, from which they can give grades to their students. <br>
In the Teacher class create a method that allows to calculate the average grade of particular student and a method calculating the average grade of all teacher's students. <br>
Create a GUI of this program. Assume that there is only one teacher from whichever subject. Through the GUI you can: 
- add new students to the system (and immidiately assign him to the only teacher) [in tab 1] <br>
- enter a grade for a particular student [in tab 2] <br>
- using JButton, display in JPanel, average grade of a particular student [in tab 2] <br>
  
Note 1: Remeber to add the appropriate parameters to all classes (names, surnames, subject for the teacher etc.) <br>
Note 2: Grades are within the 1-6 range, so you should not be able to go beyond that; in general, eliminate as many potential problems as possible, that can occur during bad usage of the program </i>
